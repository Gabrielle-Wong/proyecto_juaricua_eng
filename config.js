Between April 2019 and September 2024, while the number of listings from single-unit hosts decreased from 9,749 to 8,440, the number of listings from multi-unit hosts ballooned 67% from 10,819 to 18,142. <br> <br> The maps below illustrate the increase in the number of Airbnb units between 2019 and 2023, and in particular how these units are increasingly owned by mega-hosts.

            description: 'Residents of la Colonia Juárez, locally known as Juaricuas, have been actively resisting displacement and the redevelopment of their neighborhood for over a decade. Juaricuas, in this context, refers to the tenants and neighbors of la Colonia Juárez who are fighting for the right to safe, stable, and autonomous housing in their neighborhood. <br> <br> From this group of neighbors, the [ 06600 ] Colonia Juárez Neighborhood Platform and Observatory (06600 being the postal code) emerged in 2014, a space dedicated to defending the neighborhood against developers, and to ensuring the continued presence of its residents. The group is led by residents of La Juárez, organizing around the needs of the community, connecting struggles and proposing solutions in a collaborative, creative, proactive, and collective manner. They focus on sharing and reproducing activist methods to combat <em> blanqueamiento por despojo</em> (which translates to whitening by dispossession), a term that stems from Juaricua activism, naming this process as similar but not identical to what the west calls \'gentrification\'. <br> <br> The group were key players in organizing against the Chapultepec Cultural Corridor project in 2015, and they also played a major role in the 2019 incorporation of Article 59, which defines the Human Right to Adequate Housing, and Article 60, which addresses the forced displacement of long-established residents, into the Constitutional Law of Human Rights in Mexico City. The group’s efforts focus on averting the displacement of residents and small businesses in the neighborhood, which also fuels the loss of jobs. They seek to counteract and mitigate the effects of the capitalist real estate market on land and territory in Mexico City, which fuel forced displacement and bring higher rental prices to the neighborhood.',

            description: 'Dinamarca 77 is one building in  Colonia Juárez where the effects of the capitalist real estate market are evident. 12 families are estimated to have been forcefully evicted in April 2018.  This building opened as 11 Airbnb units in October 2023. They are owned by Mr.W, the mega-host that owns the most units in Mexico City. <br> <br>Mr. W was established in 2017 by brothers Luís Carlos Weber Zetina and Carlos Enrique Weber Zetina. Until 2019, their presence in Cuauhtémoc was relatively small (< 50 units), but they have since grown to host over 350 units in Cuauhtémoc. The company does not directly own these units. Rather, they are property managers that serve as an intermediary between property owners and potential guests, handling advertising and guest communication in exchange for a portion of the rental income. A spokesperson for the company estimates Airbnb could earn a landlord 30-40% more income from their unit compared to traditional rentals [3]. This is a clear incentive for landlords to evict families and turn the keys over to managers like Mr. W. ',

The tenant quoted above had been living in Nápoles 35 for 35 years, and in an instant their life was forever changed. Most tenants in these buildings could not afford to stay in Colonia Juárez, and organizers with [ 06600 ] Plataforma Vecinal y Observatorio de la Colonia Juárez have lost contact with many. <br> <br> Following these December 2020 evictions, developers dramatically renovated these two buildings, and in October 2023, this Virtual Homes-managed building, renamed <em> Pandora </em>, opened for business.

            description:'As these maps and personal testimonies illustrate, Airbnb has had a tremendous impact on the daily lives of Mexico City residents in the city’s central core. In the case of Airbnb redevelopments like Dinamarca 77 and Pandora, tenants\' lives are upended, first through the trauma of the violent evictions they were forced to experience, and then by the difficulty residents often have in finding housing in their budget in the neighborhood. <br> <br> Available data [4] on average rents in Colonia Juárez show that rent increased at a faster rate compared to Mexico City as a whole, particularly during the period Airbnb listings were rapidly being added to the market. We observe this especially in 2022 as global tourism ‘bounced back’ following international travel restrictions of the COVID-19 era. This increase could be due in part to Airbnb taking housing off the local market and turning them into short-term rentals with inflated nightly costs. This graph also reveals how it is important to look to the neighborhood scale to determine Airbnb’s impact on rental prices - Mexico City is too vast to use city-wide rental data to reflect Airbnb’s impact. Other neighbourhoods with high numbers of Airbnb listings show similar patterns. ',

            description:'The increase in Airbnb units also impacts the types of businesses that emerge in a given neighborhood, with higher-priced restaurants, cafes, shops and boutiques emerging that cater to the tastes of elite consumers and foreign tourists [5]. This is evident in Colonia Juárez. The emergence of Airbn-Buildings also often entails the displacement of commercial businesses as well. For example, the conversion of Dinamarca 77 to Airbnb units also displaced a <em>Comida Corrida</em> restaurant and a corner store at the street level, transforming these commercial spaces into several upscale boutiques. <br> <br> The whitewashing of these buildings also creates an alternate rendering of the neighborhood, a polished facade reminiscent of former eras of Mexico’s elite. Organizers with [ 06600 ] Plataforma Vecinal y Observatorio de la Colonia Juárez call this <em>blanqueamiento por despojo</em> - whitening by dispossession [6]. Whitening, here, refers to not only the literal whitewashing of the buildings after tenants are dispossessed, painted over in bland ‘neutral’ color schemes, but also the ways that housing dispossession is not only an economic but a racialized process.',

Colonia Juárez is home to a multitude of Indigenous residents from diverse nations, especially ñañú, mazahua and triqui peoples. Indigenous residents have noted that they experience racism in the neighborhood and are often treated as if they do not belong in this part of the city [7].  Yet many families are resisting displacement and insisting on their right to remain in La Juárez - [ 06600 ] has documented the evictions of Indigenous families over the past ten years in Colonia Juarez, both past and ongoing: <ul> <li> In 2014, more than 20 Indigenous families were evicted and displaced from Marsella 58, on the corner of Nápoles. </li> <li> In 2018 there was a brutal eviction of more than 25 Indigenous families who were displaced from Roma 18. After 8 years of taking over the streets and living in an encampment, their resistance was victorious and they succeeded at obtaining housing from INVI. </li> <li> In 2019 there was a violent eviction and struggle where more than 28 Indigenous families were displaced from the building Londres 9. </li> <li> In October 2021, more than 22 Indigenous Mazahua families were violently expelled from their homes in Turín 46, but they resisted what they considered to be an illegal eviction and succeeded at remaining in the building. Today they are fighting to claim eminent domain and to build social housing on the site. </li> <li> In 2024, three Indigenous families were displaced from Turin 41. </li> <li> At present, Indigenous families living in Abraham Gonzalez 66 are also seeking to claim eminent domain and build social housing on the site. </li> </ul> <br> These instances of violent mass eviction are more prevalent and normalized for lives deemed less valuable within broader processes of racialization and territoriality in Mexico [7].

            description: 'The growth of Airbnb and its impacts on local populations are not natural nor inevitable. Rather, the whitening of Colonia Juárez and Mexico City’s other neighborhoods has been pursued intentionally. In October 2022, Airbnb announced that it would partner with Mexico City’s government explicitly to  “promote the city as a global hub for remote workers…and the Capital of Creative Tourism” [8]). While the announcement claimed Airbnb would provide economic opportunities to Mexicans (through jobs in the tourism industry), Mexico City has since shifted its opinion of digital nomads - at least in its treatment of their short-term housing rentals. <br> <br> In 2024, the government of Mexico City implemented new regulations regarding Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms, calling for the creation of a list of all the short-term rental hosts, documenting their Tax Identification Number alongside accreditation or ownership of the unit [9]. In September 2024, the municipal government stated that while the host listings had not been completed, hosts now won’t be able to renew their licenses if they have occupation rates over 50% of the year, if they try to list additional properties, or to extend rental periods.  <br> <br> In response to these regulations, Airbnb itself has funded local campaigns and reports that portray Airbnb hosts as “mom and pop” businesses whose rental units are benefiting local economies and sustaining their livelihoods. Yet as our research shows, the marked increase in Airbnb units since 2022 is not driven by “mom and pop” owners - it is the result of corporate mega-landlords whose presence has driven up the cost of rent in Colonia Juárez and in other neighborhoods with a large Airbnb presence.

            description: 'The mega-landlords that own and/or manage buildings like Dinamarca 77 and Pandora purchase them because they see these buildings not as homes, as the tenants who were evicted did, but as properties from which they can turn a profit. This phenomenon is known as the financialization of housing - the treatment of housing as a financial asset by investors rather than as a human right [10]. <br> <br> Although the financialization of housing is not new, its impacts have been magnified through digital platforms and tools. Smartphones and apps (and the data and analytical capabilities they enable) allow investors to manage large and increasingly complex property portfolios [11]. They enable financialization at greater speeds, broader scales, and with increased profit potential. <br. <br>Short-term rental platforms like Airbnb create opportunities for a new kind of financialization.  They cater to a growing class of mobile, relatively wealthy remote workers (and foreign tourists) who can afford to pay far higher rents than locals. Furthermore, by sidestepping long-term tenant regulations and protections, Airbnb gives hosts much more flexibility and control over their properties [12].  For investors like Mr W and Virtual Homes, the revenue potential is too great to ignore.  <br> <br> This phenomenon is not unique to Mexico City [13].  A professional industry of property managers, landlords, and real estate platforms has emerged in tandem with Airbnb in cities across the world. The boutiques and facades of CDMX are a local expression of a global system that values capital investments and profit over human lives and community cohesion.',

            description: 'Although the municipal government’s recent policies signal a desire to slow the growth of Airbnb, it is unclear how successful they will be, and how well the new rules will be enforced. Available data from 2024 suggests that the number of Airbnb listings in Alcaldía Cuauhtémoc has remained relatively steady throughout the year. Although the striking increases in listings observed in 2022-2023 have slowed, the thousands of Airbnb units established during these years remain. Digital nomads continue to take selfies on Mexico City’s streets, and gentrification continues to shape the cultural and economic landscape. <br> <br> However, residents in neighborhoods like La Juárez are not accepting these changes as inevitable. Blanqueamiento por despojo and gentrification are ongoing, and are rooted in longer histories of dispossession in Mexico City. Yet Juaricuas are not deterred - they continue to practice everyday and creative forms of resistance to Airbnb and other forms of capitalist speculation in their neighborhood. These modes of resistance are visible and forthright, as wheat pasted posters or painted murals on buildings where residents are resisting displacement. Others are perhaps less obvious, such as a street vendor continuing to sell their goods even after the buildings they share the sidewalk with have been whitewashed. Juaricuas continue to insist on the right to remain in their neighborhood, in their homes, on their terms. <em> El barrio es de quien lo trabaja. La lucha sigue. </em>',
